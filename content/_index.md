Hiya :wave: â€“ My name is Aidan and welcome to my little slice of the internet! I'm a software developer interested in all kinds of JVM and functional programming. Currently, I'm an Android developer @ [Strava](https://www.strava.com).

You can find me riding bikes or on the internet at [Github](https://github.com/Plastix) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aidan-pieper-7a6591168/).
