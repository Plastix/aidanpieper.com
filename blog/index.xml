      <description>One of my favorite blog posts is Amanda Hill&amp;rsquo;s Android ImageView ScaleType: A Visual Guide. For some reason, I can never remember Android&amp;rsquo;s different image scaling modes and a visual reference guide really works for me.
This post takes inspiration from Amanda and does the same thing but for Jetpack Compose&amp;rsquo;s Arrangement property.1

      <description>TL;DR Compose is a pretty great UI framework and you should try it out. However, it still has some teething pains in beta!
 I&amp;rsquo;ll be the first to admit that I&amp;rsquo;ve been pretty slow to adopt many of the libraries in Android&amp;rsquo;s first party Jetpack suite. Today, I want to talk about my initial thoughts with Jetpack Compose, Android&amp;rsquo;s new declaritve UI toolkit which went into Beta a few weeks ago.</description>

      <description>Recently, I had a fun bug at work which ultimately stemmed from a very simple problem — hidden localization. I needed to interpolate a String in Kotlin but didn&amp;rsquo;t want to use Kotlin&amp;rsquo;s string literal interpolation feature.1 Therefore I opted for Java&amp;rsquo;s String.format method; Kotlin provides a handy fun String.format(vararg args: Any?): String extension for this.
val string = &amp;#34;%d dollars&amp;#34;.format(2) println(string) // Prints &amp;#34;2 dollars&amp;#34; as expected However, I had missed an important part of the documentation:</description>
